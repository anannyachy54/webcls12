                Santorini is a volcanic island in the Cyclades group of the Greek islands. 
                It is located between Ios and Anafi islands. It is famous for dramatic views, 
                stunning sunsets from Oia town, the strange white aubergine (eggplant), the town of Thira,
                 and naturally its very own active volcano.</p>

                Santorini is one of the great natural wonders of the world, and its main attraction is the landscape and seascape of the island itself. 
                In all, there have been at least twelve large explosive volcanic eruptions.</p>

                 But the configuration of the present, 
                roughly semicircular island is the result of an enormous volcanic explosion which occurred probably around 1630 BC,
                 literally blowing the top off the island and changing.

            <p id="id3">
               It had been a typical half-submerged mountain of an Aegean island
                into a flooded crescent caldera, in the middle of which a few small smoking islands still bear witness to volcanic activity.

                Santorini has no rivers, and water is scarce. Until the early 1990s locals filled water cisterns from the rain,
                 from small springs, and with imported assistance from other areas of Greece.

             <p>An alternative name for Santorini is Thira. Santorini is also a name for the family of islands surrounding Thira,
                  once forming a single island prior to a major volcanic event known in human history in approximately 1628 BC.</p>
